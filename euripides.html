            <h3>EURIPIDES</h3>
            <h4>Identity &amp; Web Design</h4>
           This project involved creating a fictitious company, project packaging and a piece of promotional material. I chose to create a high end skate company, primarily because it would offer me chance to try something different.

                   <h4>Process</h4>
                        I settled on the name Euripides (after the Greek playwright) primarily because I liked the sound and the way it looked in print, but also because I felt it appropriate, given his work that blurred the lines between gods and normal men and women. It seemed to fit a company who's purpose is to sell tools of speed and adventure. I started with a series of script type faces to counter the clean sans serif look of most skate companies. Typical to how I normally work, I would end up taking small bits from various type experimentations and pull them together into the final product.

                   <h4>Website</h4>
        The final piece of the project was to create some for of promotional material i.e. a flyer or poster. I took it a step further by creating a website. While not going so far as to fully write a backend (something a tad bit out of my scope anyway), I did fully build a landing and product page for my fictions company. My reasons were twofold: first off, I felt that, realistically, in today’s world, a web presence is much more valuable than printed advertisement, and secondly, I simply enjoy making websites.
