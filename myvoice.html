            <h3>MY VOICE</h3>
            <h4>Art direction/Front End Development</h4>
        <p>

            This was a project with a very tight time schedule that required three separate, concurrent teams. We needed to design and launch a website to allow students to submit ideas for change within the university, a website to allow them to vote on those ideas and a marketing campaign to inform them of this unique opportunity for student involvement. I oversaw all three teams; one for the submission website, one for the voting website and one for the marketing campaign.
</p>
<p>

</p>

        In addition to Art/UI direction, I designed the logo, the voting website and the majority of the marketing elements for this project.
    </p>

            <div class="projecttext"><h4>MARKETING</h4><p>In my position as art director I worked with multiple teams of designers, developers and marketing to ensure that our style and branding/messaging worked across all platforms and media. The project itself was a new internal center within the University, created to engage students in change. This meant we needed to make sure our message got across amidst a large campus full of strict and similar branding standards. To that end, I purposefully broke away from busy, overly designed imagery. The use of large amounts of negative space and the cartoony images stood in stark contrast to all the other local imagery, and the student character mascots helped reinforce the student centric nature of the project.</p></div>

            <div class="projecttext"><h4>Student Change</h4>
<p>

As part of an effort to unsure transparency for the project, I also designed and built the accompanying project update blog (on a WordPress backend) as well as designing the Student Change logo. </p></div>
