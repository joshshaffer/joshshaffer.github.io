What is this?
  </dt>
    <dd>
      This is an independent and original Batman story.
    </dd>
    <dt>
Who made this?
  </dt>
    <dd>
      This entire thing is a <a href="https://twitter.com/strangegods">one man show</a>. I wrote, drew, colored and lettered the comic, along with designing and coding the website.
    </dd>
    <dt>
Is this an official Batman story?
  </dt>
    <dd>
      Nope. This work is in no way associated with or authorized by either DC Entertainment or Warner Bros.
    </dd>
    <dt>
Are you making any money off of this?
  </dt>
    <dd>
      Not a dime. You may have noticed a distinct lack of advertising on this site, and this comic will never be repackaged and printed. (So please don't sue me, Warner Bros!)
    </dd>
    <dt>
What are you trying to accomplish with this?
  </dt>
    <dd>
      Simply put, I had a Batman story that I wanted to tell. My day job is a graphic designer/front end web designer, and I was looking for additional side artistic outlets. This is just for fun.
